# MYSQL task 
Before looking at the two datasets: World DB and Create DB, I defined some terminology that will be used in MySQL to consolidate my technical knowledge. I can demonstrate MySQL queries and statements to retrieve the data from the dataset table. Also, I created an EER Diagram of the dataset to identify the relationship between tables (primary and foreign keys).

## SQL: 
+ SELECT statment 
+ WHERE Clause
+ AND, OR and NOT Operators
+ ORDER BY Keyword
+ LIMIT Clause
+ LIKE Operator
+ BETWEEN Operator
